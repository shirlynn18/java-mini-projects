# Java Mini Projects

A collection of beginner-level Java programs created to reinforce fundamental programming concepts such as control structures, user input handling, and logical operations. These projects were developed as part of coursework and self-practice during Marchâ€“April 2025.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects Included

### 1. Car Rental System
A simple Java program that calculates rental charges based on car type (`Compact`, `Sedan`, `SUV`) and rental duration (`daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`). Discounts are applied for weekly (15%) and monthly (30%) rentals.

- **Technologies:** Java, `JOptionPane`
- **Highlights:**
  - Discount logic using conditional statements
  - GUI interaction via `JOptionPane`
  - Modular code for calculating rates

### 2. Exam Eligibility Checker
This program checks whether a student is eligible to sit for exams based on:
- **Attendance:** Must be â‰¥ 75%
- **Assignments:** Average score must be â‰¥ 50%

- **Inputs:** Total classes, attended classes, and scores of 3 assignments  
- **Output:** Eligibility result message

- **Technologies:** Java (Console-based)

### 3. Arithmetic Calculator with Menu
A console-based calculator that allows users to perform:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulo (Remainder)

- **Features:**
  - Menu-driven interface using `switch`
  - Input validation to prevent division by zero
  - Repeats until user exits
